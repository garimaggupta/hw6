## About the Project:
The focus of this project was to use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities and use `localStorage` to store any persistent data. The dashboard will display the current weather of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, which will be color coded based on the value being low, moderate or high. It will also display the five-day forecast with its date, temperature, weather icon, humidity. The search history will be added as buttons for future retreival.

### User Story

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
